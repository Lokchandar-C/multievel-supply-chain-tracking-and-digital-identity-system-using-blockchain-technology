Decentralized logistics and blockchain technology can work together to create a more efficient and secure supply chain system. 
By using blockchain to track changes in the type of transport, businesses can reduce the risk of errors and increase transparency.

Since blockchain transactions are immutable and transparent, all parties involved in the supply chain can have confidence in the 
accuracy of the data. This can help reduce disputes and delays caused by errors or discrepancies in the supply chain.

steps that can be taken to implement blockchain technology into a three-level transport system:
*Define the supply chain process 
*Choose a blockchain platform
*Develop a smart contract: tion, and timestamp
*Implement a supply chain tracking system
*Establish a digital identity system
*Integrate the digital identity system 

the supply chain process is planned in three steps :
Plane transportation from Station A to Station B
Drone transportation from Station B to Station C
Car transportation from Station C to Station D

blockchain platform planned for this is Hyperledger Fabric for its high throughput, confidentiality, and scalability.
